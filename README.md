# Little Black Book 

This application was developed to retieve and display data into an Angular application by sending HTTP requests to a public REST API. This was built as a coding challenge for a technical interview for Nuvalence.io. to show overall understanding of the Angular frontend framework for building UI's and transferring data between client and server. The application is structured with the intention to keep shared files in the 'shared' directory, such as services and interfaces. This application retrieves random demographic and other pretend personal data and returns in the response, displaying in the UI. It is working, and there is more work needed to perfect the UI. This project was developed as a coding challenge to show my Angular development skills, especially data flow between the client and RESTful API as part of the interview process for an Angular Developer position with NuValence.io.

## Getting Started

```
npm install -g @angular/cli@9

```
npm install
```

Set up Angular environment locally:
To run this project locally, you will need to install the Angular Command Line Interface ('AngularCLI' is the common term) by running the following command from terminal, powershell, or bash:

npm install -g npm

npm install -g @angular/cli

Note: If you have a permissions/administrator error while installing globally (with -g), add the word 'sudo' before the global installation

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
Install Angular Material Component Library
Angular Material is a powerful Angular component library, developed by Google, for Angular applications that gives developers access to a range of modern UI components that work across web, mobile, and desktop applications with minimal custom CSS and setup.

To setup Angular Material locally, run the following from your command line:

ng add @angular/material
For more information on integrating Angular Material components, review the Material documentation here:

https://material.angular.io/guides
Install npm dependencies from the command line by running:

npm install
To RUN the application, run the following command:
ng serve or
npm run start
Navigate to localhost:4200 and you should see this in the URL:

http://localhost:4200/

To TEST code coverage, run the following command:
npm run test or
ng test
To generate a TEST REPORT of detailed code coverage, run the following command:
npm run coverage or
ng test --code-coverage
Have fun searching for your favorite movies and contributing to the UI!

### Awesome Relative History: In the mid 1800's Ada Lovelace wrote an article with an Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She realized how line by line CODES could be created for Charles' Byron's first computer, the 'analytical engine' to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as LOOPING with CONDITIONALS that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the Swiss Journal. For her work, Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer.
